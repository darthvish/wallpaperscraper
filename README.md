wallpaperscraper
================
######Right now having some issues in script. so wallpapers not downloading correctly. I am  working on it..
This python script download all wallpapers from [simpledesktops](http://simpledesktops.com) and support resuming so if you loose 
your internet connection or want to download later just start script again to downloading remaining wallpapers.
How to use
-----------
To run this script just download script and put in somewhere your computer and run script using using usual method.
`python simple_desktop_scraper.py` at first time it will ask path where to save wallpapers. To stop script you have terminate
script. To terminate on linux use `Ctrl + z` for terminate on windows use `Ctrl + c`. once path given it will start to gather all image links.
just sit and few hours it will download all images(depend on your internet connectiong but don't worry you can just
terminate script or start again to download again without downloading already downloaded wallpapers again)
